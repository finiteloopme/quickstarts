# AMQP cloudlet quickstart


The AMQP cloudlet quickstart can be used as a base for the fat-jar AMQP microservices. If you wanna create a simple
backend application capable of exposing AMQP-endpoint and handling the AMQP-based communication, the AMQT cloudlet
quickstart is the best way to start your development efforts.
Documentation for this quickstart
can be found [here](https://github.com/rhiot/rhiot/blob/master/docs/readme.md#amqp-cloudlet-quickstart).
