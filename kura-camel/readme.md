# Kura Camel quickstart


The Kura Camel quickstart can be used to create Camel router OSGi bundle project deployable into the 
[Eclipse Kura](https://www.eclipse.org/kura) gateway. Kura is a widely adopted field gateway software for the
IoT solutions. Rhiot supports Kura gateway deployments as a first class citizen and this quickstart is intended to be
used as a blueprint for the Camel deployments for Kura. It uses [Camel Kura component](http://camel.apache.org/kura.html) 
under the hood.
Documentation for this quickstart
can be found [here](https://rhiot.gitbooks.io/rhiotdocumentation/content/quickstarts/kura_camel_quickstart.html).
